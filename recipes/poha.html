        <p>Poha, also known as flattened rice, has its origins in India and is believed to have originated in the state of Maharashtra. The process of making poha involves parboiling the rice, then flattening it to create the thin, flattened flakes. 

            Historically, poha was a staple food in many Indian households due to its ease of preparation, long shelf life, and versatility. It was also a popular choice for breakfast or as a snack.
            
            The dish gained popularity not just in Maharashtra but spread to various parts of India, each region adding its own twist to the recipe. Different variations emerged based on local tastes and preferences, incorporating various spices, vegetables, nuts, and sometimes even meat.
            
            Poha's simplicity, quick cooking time, and the ability to absorb flavors easily have contributed to its widespread popularity, making it a beloved dish enjoyed across the country and beyond.</p>
